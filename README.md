## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I think it would be great if users can also send their own advice. Maybe adding in a simple server could do the trick.

### Useful resources

-   [Vue.js Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - Reading the documentation helped me a lot on the basics of how I can create a basic vue app.
-   [6 Creative Ideas for CSS Link Hover Effects](https://css-tricks.com/css-link-hover-effects/) - This is an amazing article which helped me design custom link hover effects. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to be a little bit extra on styling their links.
